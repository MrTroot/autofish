## XPlus Autofish

XPlus Autofish is a temp update of [MrTroot's Autofish mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/autofish) to 1.19.4+.

In short, just cast the fishing rod into the water once, and it will automatically reel in at the correct time and recast after a couple second wait. You can open the config screen of the mod via hotkey (V by default).
